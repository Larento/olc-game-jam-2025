= Ideas

We can go in the obvious direction and a not so obvious one. I think it's better to be straightforward than quirky. There are also different types of games to make - a puzzle-like game or more of a hands-on action-packed type of game. I'm leaning towards the second one.

| Pressed for Time
| Puzzle, time-attack
| You work at an unusual metal stamping factory. Your job is to shape workpieces into parts. But the guy who gives you orders is a total nut. Unlike a regular metal stampimg process, the part you have to make always changes, so be on high alert and use only the stamping presses you need. Sometimes you also have to flip or rotate the workpiece. Using different combinations of presses you can make (or ruin) you part, at which point you have to finish the next one already!

| Shape Hopper
| Platformer, action
| You are a spider trapped in a weird dimension. Naturally, you want to escape this wretched place. But for that you need to find the exit first! Luckily you have your spidey senses that point towards the direction of exit. Jump from one moving shape to another, marching towards freedom. Be careful to not fall into the void!

== Winner

I think I'm going to go with *Shape Hopper*. I think there's some fun to be had with procedural shape and level generation.
